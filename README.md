# HW5 #
Homework for week 8, due March 13 at 11:59 PM.

# Set Up #
We are (currently) using Jupyter notebook to do homework. See previous homework README for instructions.

1. Launch the Anaconda prompt, and type jupyter notebook to launch Jupyter notebook on your computer. Alternatively launch the Anaconda navigator and click on Jupyter Notebook.

2. Download the homework, and find the homework file in Jupyter's file manager.

3. Open the homework and do it.

4. When you are done, `git add -A`, `git commit` and `git push`.

# Testing #
To test your solutions, run the `test_all()` cell. You may need to select Kernel -> Restart and Run All Cells first.

We will run our own test suite against your solutions. This means that the tests we provide are NOT comprehensive and there may be some edge cases where your code breaks. To avoid these issues, please read the questions carefully, write your own test cases if needed, and discuss with your fellow classmates about edge cases. We will usually NOT answer these questions on Piazza, but you are free to discuss.

# Submission #
Please PUSH (if it's not on your online GitHub repository, it wasn't pushed) your homework to your designated GitHub repository.

Homework MUST be submitted by 11:59pm local time (CST, or CDT if daylight savings time is active). We will grade whatever you last submitted at or before 11:59pm.

We DO NOT accept excuses unless accompanied with a medical note or official documents. Please contact [Shotaro Ikeda](mailto:ikeda2@illinois.edu) if there is any concern. Otherwise, we will probably deny late submissions. Unacceptable reasons include, without limitation, "I couldn't push my homework", "My computer ate my dog", and "My Linux partition died on me because I ran an O(2^n) problem that you gave me, which caused a buffer overflow that proceeded to rewrite my Master Boot Record".

# Mistakes #
Please post on Piazza, ask someone in course staff, or contact [Shotaro Ikeda](mailto:ikeda2@illinois.edu) as soon as possible with issues. This includes clarifications to questions, manual regrade requests if you have good reason to believe the autograder was wrong ("I passed all your test cases!" doesn't count), and other general submission issues.

# Receiving Help #
Come to office hours, ask your friend, ask the internet! Anything goes. However, please cite any code or algorithm that is not your own. Remember also that the homeworks are practice for you; you'll only get better if you spend at least a little time working at it rather than blindly Google searching everything. Also, do not post large snippets of code publicly to Piazza.

When asking for help from course Staff, please do not show us code and ask us to debug it, unless you have:

1. Commented EVERY SINGLE line explaining your line of thought ("I took a list and iterated through it" does not count)

2. [Grabbed the nearest available rubber duck and explained your code to it.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging)

3. Constructed a detailed outline of your thought process.

# Cheating #
We take cheating very seriously. If you get caught cheating, we will report it to the department and bad things happen. Just don't risk it, it's not worth it. We have a very lenient sourcing policy for this reason.
